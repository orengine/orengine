/// This macro creates a new thread local pool.
/// Because it is thread local it is lockless.
///
/// You can use this pool for reusing allocated in heap memory.
///
/// # Guard and releasing
///
/// Generated pool has a method `acquire()` that returns a guard for the pool.
/// It implements [`Deref`](core::ops::Deref) and [`DerefMut`](core::ops::DerefMut).
///
/// When the guard is dropped the value is released back to the pool.
///
/// If you want to get value from guard you can use the guard's method `into_inner`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - vis: Visibility specifier for the generated structs and methods (e.g., pub, pub(self)).
///
/// - `pool_thread_static_name`: Name of the thread-local static pool.
///
/// - `pool_struct_name`: Name of the pool struct.
///
/// - `value_type`: Type of values stored in the pool.
///
/// - `guard_name`: Name of the guard struct that manages values acquired from the pool.
///
/// - `new`: A block that defines how to create new instances of the value type when the pool is empty.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::ops::Deref;
/// use orengine::new_local_pool;
///
/// new_local_pool! {
///     pub,
///     MY_THREAD_LOCAL_POOL,
///     MyPool,
///     String,
///     MyGuard,
///     { String::with_capacity(1024) }
/// }
///
/// let mut guard = MyPool::acquire();
///
/// assert_eq!(guard.capacity(), 1024);
/// // do some work
///
/// guard.clear(); // clear the value after use
/// // guard is dropped and released back to the pool
/// ```
