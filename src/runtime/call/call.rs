/// The `Call` enum encapsulates different actions that an executor can take
/// after a future yields [`Poll::Pending`](std::task::Poll::Pending).
/// These actions may involve scheduling
/// the current task, signaling readiness, or interacting with sync primitives.

/// # Safety
///
/// After invoking a `Call`, the associated future **must** return `Poll::Pending` immediately.
/// The action defined by the `Call` will be executed **after** the future returns, ensuring

/// the current state of the future. Use this mechanism only if you fully understand the
/// implications and safety concerns of moving a future between different states or threads.
