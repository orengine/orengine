///
/// This enum is enabled only when debug assertions are active (i.e., in non-release builds)
/// due to the use of the `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` attribute.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - [`None`](BorrowingState::None): Represents the state where no borrowing is
///   currently taking place. The resource is free to be borrowed in any mode.
///
/// - [`Shared(usize)`](BorrowingState::Shared): Represents the state where the resource is being

///   currently in effect.
///
/// - [`Exclusive`](`BorrowingState::Exclusive`): Represents the state where the resource is being
///   borrowed exclusively. No other borrows (shared or exclusive) are allowed while in this state.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// [`BorrowingState`] is intended for use with `debug_assertions` to aid in verifying or enforcing
/// borrowing rules at runtime.

/// # async fn send_data(counter: &Data) {}
///

///     let mut local_ref = counter.borrow_mut();
///     if is_valid_data(&*local_ref) {
///         dump_data(&*local_ref).await; // Here the executor can execute other task, that change the data to invalid
///         send_data(&*local_ref).await;

///
///     false
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - `Local` is used in one thread;
/// - Before every `await` operation, [`LocalRef`] and [`LocalRefMut`] need to be dropped, if
///   other task can mutate the value and.
///
/// It is checked with `debug_assertions`. If you cannot guarantee compliance with the above rules
/// you should use [`LocalMutex`](crate::sync::LocalMutex) or
/// [`LocalRWLock`](crate::sync::LocalRWLock) instead. Local synchronization-primitives have
/// almost the same performance as `Local` or `Rc<RefCell>` and can be used in single-threaded
/// concurrency context.  
///
/// # Shared-Nothing and [`spawn_local`](crate::Executor::spawn_local)
///
/// In Rust, when working with local, task-specific data, you may want to leverage
/// shared-nothing concurrency by isolating data to specific threads.
/// Using the `Local` struct with [`spawn_local`](crate::runtime::Executor::spawn_local)
/// (which ensures that a task runs in a local thread) allows you to maintain this isolation.
/// Since `Local` cannot be transferred to another thread, it enforces the
/// shared-nothing principle, where each every thread holds and manages its own data independently.

///
/// ```no_run
/// use orengine::local::Local;
/// use orengine::Executor;
/// use orengine::local_executor;
///
/// Executor::init().run_with_local_future(async {
///     let local_data = Local::new(42);

///
///     *local_data.borrow_mut() += 1;

///     println!("Updated value: {}", local_data);
