* `tokio`
* `may`
* `orengine`

Second argument that is the server address (default is `localhost:8083`).

Example command: `cargo run --release orengine localhost:8083`

## Run client

Run client with one argument with one of the following values:

* `std`
* `async-std`
* `tokio`
* `smol`
* `orengine`

Second argument that is the server address (default is `localhost:8083`).

Third argument that is the number of messages (default is 5,200,000).

Fourth argument that is the number of connections (default is 512).

Example command: `cargo run --release orengine localhost:8083 5200000 512`
